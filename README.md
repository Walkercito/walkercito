Greetings, I'm Walkercito 🍉, a tech enthusiast from Cuba on a coding expedition. Currently mastering Python and exploring diverse technologies, my journey has taken me through libraries like Flet, Tkinter, PyGame, raylib5, discord.py, Telethon, Flask, PyQt5, OpenAI, and more. Join me in this coding adventure! 🚀
